# Responsible AI Training: Empowering Ethical AI Practices through Interdisciplinary Education

## Overview
This repository contains the project report and supplementary materials from the Responsible AI Training Workshop conducted by **Munenyashaishe Hove** at Botho University, Gaborone, on March 8-9, 2024. The workshop was designed to equip participants with hands-on skills to analyze, debug, and deploy ethical AI systems, leveraging Microsoft Azure tools and interdisciplinary approaches.

## Key Objectives
1. **Promote Ethical AI Practices**: Train participants to ensure fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI systems.
2. **Hands-On Learning**: Provide practical experience with tools like the Responsible AI Dashboard, Azure Content Safety, and Azure Machine Learning Prompt Flow.
3. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Foster critical thinking and dialogue on the societal implications of AI.

## Workshop Highlights
### Day 1: Responsible AI Dashboard
- **Focus**: Technical and ethical challenges in machine learning models.
- **Topics**: Error analysis, data quality, model explainability, and fairness assessment.
- **Activities**: Debugging AI models using real-world datasets.

### Day 2: Azure Content Safety and Prompt Flow
- **Azure Content Safety**:
  - **Objective**: Detect and mitigate harmful content in AI systems.
  - **Activities**: Prompt engineering for hate speech and violent content mitigation.
- **Prompt Flow Design**:
  - **Objective**: Build workflows for ethical AI deployment.
  - **Activities**: Workflow creation, visualization, and performance evaluation.

## Key Outcomes
- **Technical Proficiency**: Participants gained practical skills in debugging models, fairness audits, and harmful content mitigation.
- **Community Impact**: Established a network of ethical AI practitioners and encouraged interdisciplinary collaboration.
- **Research Potential**: Insights can inform academic work on algorithmic audits and societal impact assessments.

## Repository Contents
